    "### Step 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load the Datasets**: Use pandas to load both the `User_review_data.xlsx` and `Makeup_Products_Metadata.xlsx` files.\n",
    "- **Explore the Data**: Understand the structure of the datasets, including missing values, data types, and statistics of numerical columns.\n",
    "- **Preprocess the Data**: This might include cleaning text data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Analysis for Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyse Reviews**: Analyze the review scores to understand the distribution of customer satisfaction across products.\n",
    "- **Product Analysis**: Look into product categories, brands, and prices to identify popular and niche segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Recommendation System Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of your data, there are several approaches we can take to build the recommendation system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content-Based Filtering**: Use product information (e.g., category, brand, tags, and description) to recommend similar items to what a user likes. This approach will require text processing and similarity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverage user review scores to find similar users or products based on ratings. This method can be implemented using matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or using deep learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Method**: Combine both content-based and collaborative filtering to leverage both product attributes and user reviews for recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Model Implementation and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Select and Implement the Model**: Depending on the chosen approach, implement the model using appropriate libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn for simpler models, TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models).\n",
    "- **Evaluate the Model**: Use metrics suitable for recommendation systems, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for rating prediction accuracy, or precision and recall for the quality of ranked recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Prepare the Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize the approach, methodology, and results.\n",
    "- Highlight key findings from the data analysis.\n",
    "- Explain the chosen recommendation system approach, its advantages, and limitations.\n",
    "- Discuss the model's performance and potential areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the first step, which involves loading and exploring your datasets to understand their structure and the data preprocessing needed. I'll load each dataset and provide a brief overview of their contents."

The low mean score suggests either a low rating average or a different interpretation of the scale used.\n",
    "- The standard deviation is 0.022, indicating a relatively narrow distribution of average review scores.\n",
    "- The minimum and maximum average review scores are 0.0033 and 0.135, respectively, showing a wide range of customer satisfaction levels but within a low overall scoring range.\n",
    "- The 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles are 0.033, 0.048, and 0.063, respectively, suggesting most products receive similar scores.\n",

    "To proceed with building the recommendation system for C's web shop, we will need to choose between content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or a hybrid approach that combines both. Each approach has its strengths and is suited for different types of data and user needs. Here's a brief overview and how we might implement each with your datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content-Based Filtering\n",
    "- **Focus**: Recommends items similar to those a user has liked in the past, based on item features.\n",
    "- **Implementation with Your Data**:\n",
    "  - Use the `Product Information` dataset to extract features like product category, brand, tags, and description.\n",
    "  - Process text data (tags, description) using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings to capture the semantic similarity between products.\n",
    "  - For each user, recommend products similar to their previously rated or browsed items, based on these feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "- **Focus**: Recommends items by finding similar users or items based on review scores.\n",
    "- **Implementation with Your Data**:\n",
    "  - Use the `User Reviews` dataset, leveraging the review scores across different products.\n",
    "  - A model like matrix factorization (e.g., SVD) can be used to predict how a user might rate items they haven't reviewed yet, based on the latent user-item interaction patterns.\n",
    "  - Alternatively, item-based collaborative filtering can recommend items that are similar in terms of who has reviewed them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing Required\n",
    "- **User Reviews Dataset**:\n",
    "  - The dataset needs to be transformed to a long format where each row represents a user-item interaction (review), making it easier to apply collaborative filtering algorithms.\n",
    "  - Address the large number of zeros (which might represent missing data) by filtering out products not reviewed by users or imputing missing values based on some strategy.\n",
    "- **Product Information Dataset**:\n",
    "  - Clean and preprocess text data, including product descriptions and tags.\n",
    "  - Encode categorical variables like product category and brand, possibly using one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "  - Handle missing values, especially in the product category and contents columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision on Approach\n",
    "Given the datasets and objectives, **a hybrid approach** might be most effective, leveraging the strengths of both content-based and collaborative filtering:\n",
    "- **Content-based** aspects can capture the nuances of different products' features and user preferences for specific attributes (like brands or product types).\n",
    "- **Collaborative filtering** can leverage user behavior and preferences even when explicit product features might not fully capture why a product is appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Plan\n",
    "1. **Preprocess Data**: Prepare both datasets for analysis, handling missing values and encoding categorical/text features.\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**: For content-based filtering, extract and process features from the product information dataset.\n",
    "3. **Model Development**:\n",
    "   - For collaborative filtering, develop a model using the review scores to predict user-item interactions.\n",
    "   - For content-based filtering, calculate similarity scores between items based on their features.\n",
    "4. **Recommendation Generation**: Combine the outputs of both models to generate product recommendations for users.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like precision, recall, or RMSE (for rating predictions) to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendations.\n"

    "\n",
    "3. **Predict Missing Ratings**: Utilize the factorized matrices to predict missing ratings in the user-item matrix, enabling us to recommend items to users based on predicted scores.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given the structure of our data, we'll simplify the process for demonstration purposes, focusing on the conceptual steps. In practice, libraries such as `scikit-learn` for simpler SVD implementations or `surprise`, a Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems, can be used to handle these tasks more efficiently.\n",
